AirBnB Clone - RESTful API Table of Contents Introduction Concepts Resources Learning Objectives Requirements Python Scripts Python Unit Tests Installation Usage Project Tasks Authors Introduction This project is a continuation of the AirBnB clone series, focusing on developing a RESTful API using Python, Flask, and other tools. The objective is to understand and implement RESTful concepts to handle CRUD operations for our application.

Concepts For this project, we will explore the following concepts:

REST API concept page Learn REST: A RESTful Tutorial Designing a RESTful API with Python and Flask HTTP access control (CORS) Flask cheatsheet What are Flask Blueprints, exactly? Modular Applications with Blueprints Flask tests Flask-CORS Learning Objectives By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

What REST means What API means What CORS means What is an API What is a REST API What are other types of APIs Which HTTP method to use to retrieve resources Which HTTP method to use to create a resource Which HTTP method to use to update a resource Which HTTP method to use to delete a resource How to request a REST API Requirements Python Scripts Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3) All files should end with a new line The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3 A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7) All files must be executable The length of files will be tested using wc All modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").doc)') All classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.doc)') All functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").my_function.doc)' and python3 -c 'print(import("my_module").MyClass.my_function.doc)') A documentation is not a simple word; it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified) Python Unit Tests Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs All files should end with a new line All test files should be inside a folder tests Use the unittest module All test files should be Python files (extension: .py) All test files and folders should start by test_ File organization in the tests folder should be the same as the project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py All tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py Strongly encourage working together on test cases to avoid missing any edge cases Installation To install Flask, run:

bash Copy code $ pip3 install Flask Usage Instructions on how to run the project and use the API will be provided here.

Project Tasks Details of each task required for the project will be listed here.
